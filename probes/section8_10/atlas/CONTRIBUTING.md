## Test fixtures are generated, not committed

`tests/fixtures/atlas_index.json` is built from `data/atlas_raw.csv` by
`scripts/build_index.py`. Run it once after cloning:

```
python scripts/build_index.py
```

If you skip it, `pytest` fails during collection with
`FixtureIndexMissing: tests/fixtures/atlas_index.json not found`.

This is a one-command, offline, deterministic build step -- it is part of
setting the project up, not a limitation of the test suite. Do not treat a
missing index as "test data unavailable"; regenerate it.

## Tests

```
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python scripts/build_index.py
pytest
```
